# Problem Statement

We often forget things to carry when we are going on a trip. To tackle this problem we have created a solution to help passengers maintain a checklist depending on the type of trip.

# What it Does?

Our product asks you where you are going and how you are travelling and based on that provides you a basic set of common things to keep wiht you tht the general public forgets and allows you to add stuff that you'd want to keep in mind.

# How we built it?
We didnt want to over complicate things and hence we didn't, we used html, css and js and ofcource worked tirelessly for the duration of the hack

# How to run it locally
Don't worry, remembering things for a trip is not as hard as going to one. 
1. Git clone the repository  in your pc.
2. Open the HTML file named "destination.html" in your pc and click on the type of place where you want to go to.
3. you will be redirected towards the mode of transportation you would be taking in the trip.
4. Once selected you would be shown a page of unlimited items that one tends to forget while on a trip.
5. This checklist will definetly help the person to always take the essentials when he/she is on the go.
