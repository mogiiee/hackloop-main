# Project Name

# We often forget things to carry when we are going on a trip. To tackle this problem we have created a solution to help passengers maintain a checklist depending on the type of trip.

To tackle this problem we present to you THE_NAME_OF_PRODUCT which can quickly give you an almost ready checklist so you dont have to do all the work

# What it Does?

Our product asks you where you are going and how you are travelling and based on that provides you a basic set of things to keep and allows you to add stuff that you'd want to keep in mind

# How we built it?

# How to run it locally
