# Problem Statement

We often forget things to carry when we are going on a trip. To tackle this problem we have created a solution to help passengers maintain a checklist depending on the type of trip

# What it Does?

Our product asks you where you are going and how you are travelling and based on that provides you a basic set of things to keep and allows you to add stuff that you'd want to keep in mind
